    "text": "1.5 Performance Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1 Static Performance Chacteristics\nA set of characteristics are defined when instrument is used for constant inputs. All static characteristics are obtained through Static Calibration\n\n\n\n\nStatic Calibration curve with effects of noise\n\n\n\nMeasured Value (MV)\n\nReading provided by instrument when certain quantity is measured.\n\nTrue Value (TV) / Actual Value (AV)\n\nIt is value measured through a method that is agreed by the experts using International Standard techniques under standard conditions.\n\nStatic Error (SE)\n\nStatic Error can be either positive or negative depending on the instrument output. \\[SE = MV - TV\\]\n\nStatic Correction (SC)\n\nStatic Correction is the opposite of Static Error, applied to get the True Value \\[SC = -SE\\]\n\nSensitivity (K)\n\nSensitivity is defined as the ratio of change in output ( \\(\\delta q_{out}\\) ) to the change in input ( \\(\\delta q_{in}\\) ) \\[K = \\frac{\\delta q_{out}}{\\delta q_{in}} = \\frac{\\text{Effect}}{\\text{Cause}}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is generally desirable to have Higher Sensitivity.\n\neg: A Mercury thermometer that gives \\(1mm/\\degree\\mathrm{C}\\) displacement is preferred over another instrument that gives \\(0.73mm/\\degree\\mathrm{C}\\)\nSensitivity (\\(K\\)) is slope of the Static Calibration Curve (\\(SCC\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinearity\n\nDegree of straight line relationship between \\(\\ q_{in}\\) and \\(\\ q_{out}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is desirable that an instrument exhibits good linearity. This makes input and output relationship predictible. However many instruments or devices exhibit Non-linearity and maybe preferred due to their other advantages.\nWhen response is linear, sensitivity can be found anywhere in the range. When it is Non-linear, since the slope changes, multiple sensitivity values are measured and expressed for smaller range of inputs.\n\nDrifts\n\nThree types of drifts are exhibited by instruments. They are Zonal drift, Span drift and Zero drift as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrifts are undesirable but they appear in instruments. Among the three, Zero and Zonal drifts are easy to eliminate.\n\nHysterisis\n\nHysteresis is the degree of non coincidence of loading and unloading curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an instrument during Static Calibration, let’s apply input in increasing direction (0 to max) leading to loading curve. Let’s next apply input in decreasing direction (max to 0) leading to unloading curve\nIdeally the two curves should overlap but in reality, they don’t. Hysteresis is present mostly in mechanical instruments which exhibit friction, inertia and backlash due to moving paths.\n\nThreshold\n\nThe smallest measurable input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the input is increased from 0, an instrument may not produce detectable output till the input crosses a certain threshold value. This is predominant in mechanical instruments.\n\nResolution\n\nResolution is the ability of an instrument to discriminate between two readings.\n\n\neg:\n\na voltmeter that can measure 10V and 11V has resolution of 1V because it cannot differentiate anything between the 10 and 11.\nAnother voltmeter that can measure 10.1V and 10.2V has resolution of 0.1V\n\n\nHigher resolution is always desirable. Digital instruments typically have higher resolution than analog instruments as number of significant digits (digits after decimal point) are easily extendable to acheive higher resolution in digital instruments.\n\n\nRepeatability\n\nWhen a certain quantity is measured again and again, repeatability is the ability of the instrument to give the same value.\n\n\nWhen same quantity is measured at different instants of time, it’s ability to give same readings is called reproducibility\n\n\n1.5.2 Dynamic Performance Characteristics\nThese characteristics define how an instruments responds to a dynamic or time varying input.\nThe general mathematical model of a dynamic instrument which is a linear differential equation can be represented by the following form:\n\\[\na_n \\frac{{d^n q_o}}{{dt^n}} + a_{n-1} \\frac{{d^{n-1} q_o}}{{dt^{n-1}}} + \\ldots + a_1 \\frac{{dq_o}}{{dt}} + a_0 q_o = b_0 x + b_1 \\frac{{dq_i}}{{dt}} + b_2 \\frac{{d^2 q_i}}{{dt^2}} + \\ldots + b_m \\frac{{d^m q_i}}{{dt^m}}\n\\] for example, In a clinical thermometer, the volume of the bulb, density and viscocity of the liquid, coefficient of linear expansion, diameter of capillary tube, etc will be some constant values and their combinations will determine \\(a\\)’s and \\(b\\)’s\nTo keep the equation simple, replace \\(\\frac{{d}}{{dt}}\\) by \\(D\\) we get:\n\\[\n(a_n D^n + a_{n-1} D^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 D + a_0)q_o = (b_0 + b_1 D + b_2 D^2 + \\ldots + b_m D^m) q_i\n\\]\nWe generally don’t require so many terms to define typical instruments. So consider a few constants are adequate to define an instrument and force all other constants to \\(0\\). Using this we classify:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2.1 Zero order instrument\nAll constants except \\(a_0\\) and \\(b_0\\) are assumed to be \\(0\\). The equation now becomes, \\[a_0 q_o = b_0 q_i\\]\n\\[q_o = \\frac{b_0}{a_0}q_i\\]\n\\[q_o = K q_i \\]\nwhere \\(k = \\frac{b_0}{a_0}\\)\n\nAny instrument that obeys the simple algebraic equation above is called the Zero order instrument\n\n\n\n1.5.2.2 First order instrument\nAll the constants except \\(a_1\\), \\(a_0\\) and \\(b_0\\) are assumed to be \\(0\\). Hence the LDE for First order instrument becomes,\nA first-order dynamic instrument can be represented by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). The general form of a first-order ODE is:\n\\[\n( a_1 D + a_0 ) q_o = b_0 q_i\n\\]\nDividing by \\(a_0\\) on both sides we get,\n\\[\n(\\frac{a_1}{a_0} D + 1) q_o = \\frac{b_0}{a_0} q_i\n\\]\nReplacing \\(\\tau = \\frac{a_1}{a_0}\\) called the time constant (in seconds)and \\(K = \\frac{b_0}{a_0}\\) called static sensitivity we get,\n\\[\n(\\tau D + 1) q_o = K q_i\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\frac{q_o}{q_i} (D) = \\frac{K}{\\tau D + 1}\n\\]\n\n\n1.5.2.3 Second order instrument\nAll constants except \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\), \\(a_0\\) and \\(b_0\\) are considered and the rest of coefficients are \\(0\\), the equation simplifies to Second order DE. Hence, any instrument that obeys this equation is called the second order instrument.\nTo derive the second-order differential equation (ODE) from the generalized ODE, we’ll start with the following generalized form:\n\\[\na_2 \\frac{{d^2 y(t)}}{{dt^2}} + a_1 \\frac{{dy(t)}}{{dt}} + a_0 y(t) = b_0 x(t)\n\\] where \\(y(t)\\) is the dynamic output due to dynamic input \\(x(t)\\). Replacing \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) by \\(D\\) we get,\n\\[\n( a_2 D^2 + a_1 D + a_0 )y(t) = b_0 x(t)\n\\] Dividing by \\(a_0\\) on both sides we get,\n\\[\n\\frac{{a_2}}{{a_0}}D^2 y(t) + \\frac{{a_1}}{{a_0}}D y(t) + \\frac{{a_0}}{{a_0}}y(t) = \\frac{{b_0}}{{a_0}} x(t)\n\\]\nReplacing,\n\n\\(\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0}{a_2}}\\) called undamped natural frequency\n\\(\\zeta = \\frac{a_1}{2 \\sqrt{a_0 a_2}}\\) called damping factor which dictates time response of the second order system and\n\\(K = \\frac{b_0}{a_0}\\) (Static senstivity) we get,\n\n\\[\n( \\frac{D^2}{\\omega_n ^ 2} + 2 \\frac{\\zeta}{\\omega_n} D + 1 ) y(t) = K x(t)\n\\] Hence the Transfer function \\(\\frac{y}{x} D\\) becomes,\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} (D) = \\frac{K}{\\frac{D^2}{\\omega_n ^ 2} + 2 \\frac{\\zeta}{\\omega_n} D + 1 }\n\\]\nIt is not a mere ratio of output and input quantities, instead it tells the general relationship that exists between output and input of a given instrument.\n\nWhen the operator is \\(D\\), it is called the Operational transfer function\nWhen the operator is \\(S\\) it is called Laplace transfer function\nWhen the operator is \\(j\\omega\\) it is called Sinusoidal transfer function\n\nLet’s look at the solution of the second order LDE. The complete solution has two parts: sum of the particular integral part and the complementary solution part,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, the type of the root is dictated by the value of damping factor and for the given value of undamped natural frequency\n\nIt is now possible to apply standard test inputs such as step input or a ramp input or a sinusoidal input and understand how each of the system responds to that input."
